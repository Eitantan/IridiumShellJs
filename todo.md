Hi. So, I was just wondering what are "enviornment" variables going to be?
What is advanced mode, and how will it change the tree?
Also, the enabling of graphics mode that enables a C-like syntax will be hard to implement since we'll have to add in a few methods into our parser in order to figure out what syntax to expect.

While the ideas are good, I think we should keep them until we have a official beta release then for the official standard release(v.1.0.1), we'll have the "enviornment" variables advanced-mode and graphics-mode.

Thoughts?
